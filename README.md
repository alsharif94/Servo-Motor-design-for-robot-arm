# Servo-Motor-design-for-robot-arm
Designing a servo motor for a robotic arm using Arduino with programming and the use of simulation programs 



Introduction 

In this task, which is considered the first task, we will design the motor, which in turn moves the robot arm as we know, moving the robot arm depends on the angle of movement, so we will choose the most appropriate motor for this task. Servo motor is the tool that enables us to control the angular or linear position of the robot arm, so we will choose this type of motor to make this task. For the servo motor to work in the required way, the microcontroller must be used to determine the required angle. We will choose the Arduino as a microcontroller, due to its ease of handling and also its programming is easy and does not require any trouble. Before installing the electronic components realistically, some simulation programs must be used to ensure that the electronic circuit is working correctly and that it is free from any errors related to installation or programming, so we will use Protues to do this task.
