# Servo-Motor-design-for-robot-arm
Designing a servo motor for a robotic arm using Arduino with programming and the use of simulation programs 



Introduction 

In this task, which is considered the first task, we will design the motor, which in turn moves the robot arm as we know, moving the robot arm depends on the angle of movement, so we will choose the most appropriate motor for this task. Servo motor is the tool that enables us to control the angular or linear position of the robot arm, so we will choose this type of motor to make this task. For the servo motor to work in the required way, the microcontroller must be used to determine the required angle. We will choose the Arduino as a microcontroller, due to its ease of handling and also its programming is easy and does not require any trouble. Before installing the electronic components realistically, some simulation programs must be used to ensure that the electronic circuit is working correctly and that it is free from any errors related to installation or programming, so we will use Protues to do this task.  



Theory 


•	Servo motor 
It is one of the most important types of motors that operate on direct currents, whose movement depends on the change in the degree of angle. Most servo motors contain a small internal control circuit whose function is to give feedback to the microcontroller to know the exact location of the motor shaft. Usually, the servo motor comes with a small gear that is installed on it. This type of gear gives high torque compared to the small size of the servo motor. One of the most famous applications of the servo motor is its use in the field of robotics, especially in their own arms. 

•	Working mechanism of servo motor

All types of servo motors have three wires connected to them. One of them is used for the power as positive electrode and the other is used as the negative electrode as a ground, while the remaining wire is connected to the microcontroller
